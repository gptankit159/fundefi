{"Title": "Heart for Women foundation",
  "Description": " More women than men die of cardiovascular disease. Yet, scientific research examines men in particular. As a result, thorough knowledge about the symptoms and causes in women is lacking. We are committed to bringing together different medical disciplines. This has made interrelationships visible. Because in addition to the heart, other organs and external influences also play a role in cardiovascular diseases. But we need even more knowledge about these connections to save women's lives. This is why the Heart for Women Foundation encourages multidisciplinary research.","Recipeint": "GCKQYW4BJCAO7MW5KXAXJA4V2RASAY7SHQ6YNFA4LLVNGVVYFITAGZN","Start Date": "12/10/2024","SubsPrice": "8","logo":"./home/Image5.jpg","user_info":"Zill" },
